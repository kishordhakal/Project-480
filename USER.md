## System Requirements 

- Windows OS 
- Java installed on the System ( to run Jar file )  

## How to use the program

- Click on Jar File to start the program. 
- Once opened, a simple GUI will appear. 
- Choose students.csv file using the first file choosing button. 
- Once clicked, it will display the directories and files to navigate through and choose.  
- Choose the schedule.csv file using the second choodin button. 
- It is better to have those two files in the same directory. 
- Once those two files are chosen, press the start button. 
- If everything goes right a message box will pop up stating the compilation of tasks and the path of the output file.
  Output file will be placed in the same directory as the students.csv.  

## Debugging the issues. 

- If any of those two files are not .csv format it will throw an error message. Simply restart the program and use the right files. 
- If any of the files have a different format than predefined format this program will not work. Correct the format and try again. 
- Format of files should be same as the testing file provided while building program to get the desired output.   
- Some computers might not be able to open .jar files. Follow the link below for some possible solutions.
